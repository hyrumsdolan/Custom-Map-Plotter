# Custom-Map-Plotter

## Description

Can plot multiple points at once on a custom map of the US with a CSV file.

## Resources

### Map Source

[https://mapsvg.com/maps/usa](https://mapsvg.com/maps/usa)

This has a downloadable SVG of the US. Ignore the $50 Buy Now, that's just for the API.
Hit "Download the Map of USA"

The file is an SVG and will look like garbage unless specifically used with an SVG editor.

### SVG Editor

[https://boxy-svg.com/](https://boxy-svg.com/)

This will allow for you to add borders (add stroke with Type:Solid option) to the states and change each states indivdual colors (shift clicking allows for batch changes)

This one worked out really well for me. The only issue I had was text size (for some reason it won't got below 15), how ever I realized after that you can just make the map bigger and the relative text size is smaller.


## Current Known Issues

### Not tested fully yet, but I assume my JSON may be missing some possible spellings of cities and may cause issues.

## Desired Next Steps

### 1. Size slider and color editor for marker






## API - DEPRECATED *

[https://www.openstreetmap.org/](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)

No API token required.

I needed this for batches of 30-50 - this option is free, but may have some limitations for bigger datasets.

Deprecation Note* I got blocked from the API, I think from reusing the same test file multiple times. I replaced this with a JSON which is much faster, but less robust if your City, State isn't already standardized.
